## Urhobo Spoken Digits

Item Name: URH-DIGITS
Author(s): {I, JN} Orife
Data Source: lavalier microphone
Audio Format: 1-channel Linear PCM, 16k, 16bit
Application: Speech Recognition
Language:	Urhobo
Language ID: urh

URH-DIGITS contains speech collected for the purpose of bootstrapping Urhobo ASR modeling efforts with the task of recognizing connected digit sequences. There is currently a single speakers pronouncing 150 digit sequences. 

The corpus was collected in an open acoustic environment with a lavalier microphone, digitized at 16kHz. The waveform files are in linear PCM format. All audio files were manually transcribed and annotated by native speakers.

URH-DIGITS is modeling after TIDIGITS, an English language connected digits recognition task
